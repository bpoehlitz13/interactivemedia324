				<span>I love cats to an irrational degree. I only own one cat, but that's mostly because if you put too many cats in one place they start fighting over each other, and I make up for the lack of cats in my house through all of the cat-related imagery I surround myself with, from my desktop wallpaper to framed photos of cats to cat calendars and a considerable number of my favorite fictional characters from all kinds of media are cats of some sort, whether they are big cats, small cats, cat-people, cat owners, cat-shapeshifters, I mean you get the picture I love cats of all kinds. I think when I move out and own an actual house someday I'm going to get a little cat of my own (or maybe two if they were littermates or something and they didn't fight with each other) but I mean I want him or her or them to be at least a little bit independent because I won't always be there for my cat(s) in between working and walking around town and trips to meet family and I wonder how many times I can talk about this cat or these cats without being definitive on whether they're singular or plural in any form.</span>
