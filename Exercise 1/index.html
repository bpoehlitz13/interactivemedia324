				<span>So the thing is, I love cats. I only own one cat, but that's mostly because if you put too many cats in one place they start fighting over each other, and I make up for the lack of physical cats in spades with all the cat-related imagery I surround myself with, from my wallpaper to framed photos to cat calendars and I think like a considerable number of my favorite fictional characters of all time are cats of some sort, big cats, small cats, cat-people, cat owners, cat-shapeshifters, I mean you get the picture I love cats of all kinds. I think when I move out and own an actual house someday I'm going to get a little cat of my own (or maybe two if they were littermates or something) but I mean I want him or her or them to be at least a little bit independent because I won't always be there for my cat(s) in between working and walking around town and trips to meet family and I wonder how many times I can talk about this cat or these cats without being definitive on whether they're singular or plural in any form.</span>
